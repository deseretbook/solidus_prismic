# Solidus Prismic

[Prismic.io](https://prismic.io) Client for use in Solidus based applications.
Prismic is a CMS Backend that can be used to suplement your site with additional
content. That content can be updated through Prismic allowing you to make changes
to your site without a deploy.

## Installation

Add solidus_prismic to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_prismic'
```

Then, run bundle install.

Create an account and repository at [Prismic.io](https://prismic.io)

After that's done, you need to set additional environment variables:
```
# These values are found at: https://yourapp.prismic.io/settings/apps/
PRISMIC_API_URL=https://yourapp.prismic.io/api # Required
PRISMIC_ACCESS_TOKEN=123FAKE456 # Only required if using a private API or preview refs
```

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```
